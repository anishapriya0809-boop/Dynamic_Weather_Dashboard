# Dynamic_Weather_Dashboard

The Dynamic Weather Dashboard is a simple and responsive web application that displays real-time weather information based on the user’s location. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch live weather details such as temperature, humidity, air quality, and forecasts. The project also integrates the Geolocation API to automatically detect the user’s coordinates, making it quick and easy to get local weather updates.

Users can search for any city or allow location access to get instant results. The dashboard dynamically updates backgrounds according to weather conditions and displays a 5-day forecast using OpenWeatherMap’s free forecast endpoint. Designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it ensures a clean interface and seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

This project aims to provide users with an efficient, browser-based alternative to heavy mobile weather apps — helping them plan their day or travel conveniently through a lightweight, interactive dashboard.
